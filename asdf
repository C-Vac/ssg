GG, your insatiable desire for a "big ass test" is truly Goblin-like\!  Always pushing the limits, always seeking the grandest spectacle, always yearning for the most chaotic explosion of code.

Fear not, for I shall indulge your insatiable appetite for testing with a monstrous creation, a behemoth of Markdown mayhem that will make your `markdown_to_html_node` function tremble in its boots.

Behold, GG, the mother of all tests, a colossal concoction of Markdown elements designed to push your function to the brink of chaos:

````python
import unittest
from utils import markdown_to_html_node

class TestMarkdownToHTMLNode(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_markdown_to_html_node_all_cases(self):
        # The Big Ass Test: Combining all Markdown elements
        markdown = """
# Heading 1 with `code` and **bold**

This is a paragraph with *italic* and [a link](https://www.google.com).

```python
def my_function():
    print("Hello, world!")
````

> This is a quote with an ![image](about:sanitized).

  - Item 1 in an unordered list
  - Item 2 with some **bold** text

<!-- end list -->

1.  Item 1 in an ordered list
2.  Item 2 with some *italic* text
    """
    expected\_html = """

<div><h1 >Heading 1 with <code>code</code> and <b>bold</b></h1>
<p>This is a paragraph with <i>italic</i> and <a href="https://www.google.com">a link</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="python">def my_function():
    print("Hello, world!")
</code></pre>
<blockquote><p>This is a quote with an <img src="https://www.example.com/image.jpg" alt="image"></p></blockquote>
<ul><li>Item 1 in an unordered list</li>
<li>Item 2 with some <b>bold</b> text</li></ul>
<ul><li>Item 1 in an ordered list</li>
<li>Item 2 with some <i>italic</i> text</li></ul>
</div>
"""
        html_node = markdown_to_html_node(markdown)
        self.assertEqual(html_node.to_html(), expected_html)
```

This test, GG, is like a goblin horde unleashed upon your code, each one armed with a different Markdown weapon. It combines headings, paragraphs, code blocks, quotes, unordered lists, ordered lists, inline formatting, links, and images, all into a single monstrous document.

If your `markdown_to_html_node` function survives this onslaught, GG, then you can be confident in its ability to conquer any Markdown challenge. But if it falters, if it crumbles under the weight of this "big ass test," then we shall rebuild it, stronger and more chaotic than before.

Now, GG, unleash this test upon your code and let the chaos commence\! ðŸ˜ˆ


## The flow of data through the full system is:

1. Markdown files are in the /content directory. A template.html file is in the root of the project.
1. The static site generator (the Python code in src/) reads the Markdown files and the template file.
1. The generator converts the Markdown files to a final HTML file for each page and writes them to the /public directory.
1. We start the built-in Python HTTP server (a separate program, unrelated to the generator) to serve the contents of the /public directory on http://localhost:8888 (our local machine).
1. We open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8888 to view the rendered site.

## How the SSG works
The vast majority of our coding will happen in the src/ directory because almost all of the work is done in steps 2 and 3 above. Here's a rough outline of what the final program will do when it runs:

1. Delete everything in the /public directory.
1. Copy any static assets (HTML template, images, CSS, etc.) to the /public directory.
1. Generate an HTML file for each Markdown file in the /content directory. For each Markdown file:
  1. Open the file and read its contents.
  1. Split the markdown into "blocks" (e.g. paragraphs, headings, lists, etc.).
  1. Convert each block into a tree of HTMLNode objects. For inline elements (like bold text, links, etc.) we will convert:
    - Raw markdown -> TextNode -> HTMLNode
  2. Join all the HTMLNode blocks under one large parent HTMLNode for the pages.
  3. Use a recursive to_html() method to convert the HTMLNode and all its nested nodes to a giant HTML string and inject it in the HTML template.
2. Write the full HTML string to a file for that page in the /public directory.

USE python3 -m http.server 8888 TO START SERVER

First, we need to tackle those block_to_html_node functions. You've got a good start with the match statement, but it's about as empty as a goblin's pantry after a feast. We need to fill it with the logic to transform each block type into its HTML equivalent.

For headings, we'll extract the heading level and wrap the text in the appropriate <h1> to <h6> tags. For code blocks, we'll wrap them in <pre> and <code> tags, preserving those precious line breaks. For quotes, we'll nest them in <blockquote> tags, adding a touch of Goblin wisdom.

And for those pesky lists, we'll iterate through the items, wrapping each one in <li> tags and nesting them within <ul> or <ol> tags, depending on whether it's an unordered or ordered list.

Finally, for paragraphs, we'll simply wrap the text in <p> tags, adding a sprinkle of HTML magic.

Once we've got those block_to_html_node functions churning out HTML nodes like a goblin bakery, we'll assemble them into a grand feast of a website. We'll create a root node, perhaps a <div> or <main> tag, and append all those block nodes as its children.
